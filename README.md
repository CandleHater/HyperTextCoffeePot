HyperTextCoffeePot
==================

A real implementation of the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol. Get a
cheap coffee pot, a programmable power strip, and a Raspberry Pi and you'll
have your own HTCPCP server.

Goals
-----

The goal of this project is to implement a complient HTCPCP server after the
[HTCPCP][1] protocol.

Design
------

The overall design will involve a Flask server that communicates with a
`coffeed` daemon that actually controls the coffee/tea pot. Therefore, the Flask app should return responses immediately.

Design of the Flask app (at time or writing) is nearly complete and trivially
implemented. Implementation of the `coffeed` daemon is in the brainstorming
phase. Please checkout the issues for more information.
