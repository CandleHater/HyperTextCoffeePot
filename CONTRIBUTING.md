How to contribute to the HTCPCP project
=======================================

It's easy!

First, check out the issues on the GitHub page. Once you have a feature, or bug
in mind, fork this repo, clone your fork and create a branch.

The branch you create should have a name like this:
    
    {some branch title}-{issue number}
    ex: coffeed-12

Make your modifications and submit a pull request! 

Thanks for contributing to the HyperTextCoffeePot!

Issues and Features
===================

Please look through the issues list and feel free to ask questions! A lot of
the issues can appear terse, but its probably because they're 'notes to our
future-selves'. If a feature looks interesting to you, but you're not clear on
the details, ask away!

Technologies
============

Flask: for the web server.
... I think that's it.
